Wanted to make another program in Rust. 

My first program ever in Rust was in https://mmulcahy222.github.io/#rust_sports_cards

Since Rust is so much faster than Python and right on the level as fast as C++, I decided to port the Python Image Reducing application to Rust (Python: https://github.com/mmulcahy222/miscellaneous/blob/master/image_reduce.py)

I did this for the purpose of massive speed gains from what I already have just to squeeze out all the juice I can from Rust & Computer Hardware, without the overhead of CPython objects & Python interpreting.

Weirdly, it was slower, LOL. Confused, I decided to go and do Prime Numbers for a million numbers with Rust & Python, then Rust was being back to being Super Fast.
